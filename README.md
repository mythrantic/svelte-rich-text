# Turborepo Tailwind CSS starter

This is an official starter Turborepo.

## Using this example

Run the following command:

```sh
npx create-turbo@latest -e with-tailwind
```

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- `ui`: a stub React component library with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `eslint-config-custom`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Building packages/ui

This example is setup to build `packages/ui` and output the transpiled source and compiled styles to `dist/`. This was chosen to make sharing one `tailwind.config.js` as easy as possible, and to ensure only the CSS that is used by the current application and its dependencies is generated.

Another option is to consume `packages/ui` directly from source without building. If using this option, you will need to update your `tailwind.config.js` to be aware of your package locations, so it can find all usages of the `tailwindcss` class names.

For example, in [tailwind.config.js](packages/tailwind-config/tailwind.config.js):

```js
  content: [
    // app content
    `src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}`,
    // include packages if not transpiling
    "../../packages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
```

### Utilities

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styles
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting

Run the following command:

```sh

```

## What's inside?

This turborepo uses [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) as a package manager. It includes the following packages/apps:

- `scripts`: Jest configurations
- `logger`: Isomorphic logger (a small wrapper around console.log)
- `tsconfig`: tsconfig.json;s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Docker

This repo is configured to be built with Docker, and Docker compose. To build all apps in this repo:

```
# Create a network, which allows containers to communicate
# with each other, by using their container name as a hostname
docker network create valiantlynx-turborepo

# Build prod using new BuildKit engine
COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1 DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build

# Start prod in detached mode
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

To shutdown all running containers:

```
# Stop all running containers
docker kill $(docker ps -q) && docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```

### Remote Caching

This example includes optional remote caching. In the Dockerfiles of the apps, uncomment the build arguments for `TURBO_TEAM` and `TURBO_TOKEN`. Then, pass these build arguments to your Docker build.

You can test this behavior using a command like:

`docker build -f apps/web/Dockerfile . --build-arg TURBO_TEAM=“your-team-name” --build-arg TURBO_TOKEN=“your-token“ --no-cache`

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io) test runner for all things JavaScript
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
