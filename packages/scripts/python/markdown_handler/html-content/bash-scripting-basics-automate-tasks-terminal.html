<p>If you're a terminal user, you know how tedious it can be to manually execute the same commands repeatedly. But what if I told you there's a way to automate these tasks and free up your time for more important things? Welcome to the exciting world of bash scripting!</p>
<p>Bash scripting is a powerful tool that lets you automate tasks in the terminal. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced user, this guide will show you the basics of how to unleash your productivity with bash scripting.</p>
<p>```bash</p>
<h1>!/bin/bash</h1>
<h1>Print the message to the console</h1>
<p>echo "Hello, world!"</p>
<h1>Store the result of the ls command in a variable</h1>
<p>files=$(ls)</p>
<h1>Print the result</h1>
<p>echo $files
```</p>
<p>First, let's dive into logging into a server using the <strong>ssh</strong> command. This opens up a whole new world of possibilities, allowing you to remotely run commands on the server and automate tasks even when you're not physically present.</p>
<p>```bash</p>
<h1>!/bin/bash</h1>
<p>echo "Hello, world!"
echo "Logging into the server!"</p>
<h1>Log into the server and run the setup.sh script</h1>
<p>ssh -i news_site.pem ubuntu@15.152.49.209 'bash -s' &lt; setup.sh</p>
<p>echo "Done!"
```</p>
<p>Next, we'll show you how to run a bash script located on the server you just logged into. Trust me, once you see the power of running scripts on a remote server, you'll be hooked!</p>
<p>```bash</p>
<h1>!/bin/bash</h1>
<p>echo "Hello, world!"
echo "Logging into the server!"</p>
<h1>Log into the server and run the setup.sh script</h1>
<p>ssh -i news_site.pem ubuntu@15.152.49.209 'bash /path/to/setup.sh'</p>
<p>echo "Done!"
```</p>
<p>And finally, we'll talk about the importance of adding comments to your bash scripts. Comments serve as a roadmap, helping you understand the purpose of your code and making it easier to maintain in the future. Plus, they help others understand your code too, making collaboration a breeze.</p>
<p>With the basics covered, you're ready to start exploring the exciting world of bash scripting! From automating tedious tasks to streamlining complex workflows, the possibilities are endless. So what are you waiting for? Let's unleash your productivity with bash scripting today!</p>
