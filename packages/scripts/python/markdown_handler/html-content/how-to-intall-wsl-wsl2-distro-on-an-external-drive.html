<p>I had this problem today. I had a WSL Ubuntu distro with important stuff on it. It was on my computer SSD (C:) drive, but I needed to reset my computer. It would be a hassle to move them manually, especially because many of them were Linux programs. So, I needed to move the whole distro. After some research, I theorized two ways to do it.</p>
<p>The first way was to install another distro on my own specified path and then move the files there using some Linux tool like SSH. However, I wasn't able to find a way to define the path.</p>
<p>The second way, which I successfully did, was to export the whole distro to an external file and then import it while defining a path to install it. This way, I didn't need to move the data manually because the data is moved with the Linux.</p>
<p>Here is how I did it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a <code>vm</code> folder beforehand on the external disk.</li>
<li>Export the WSL distribution to a tar file:</li>
<li>When exporting the code, do it as a tar file. It might just be <code>distroname.tar</code>.</li>
<li><code>wsl --export &lt;distribution_name&gt; &lt;tar_file_path&gt;</code></li>
<li>Replace <code>&lt;distribution_name&gt;</code> with the name of the distribution you want to move and <code>&lt;tar_file_path&gt;</code> with the path and filename of the tar file you want to create. For example:<ul>
<li><code>wsl --export Ubuntu D:\vm\ubuntu.tar</code></li>
<li>This will create a tar file named <code>ubuntu.tar</code> in the <code>D:\vm</code> directory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Copy the tar file to the external hard drive.</li>
<li>Import the WSL distribution from the tar file on the external hard drive:</li>
<li><code>wsl --import &lt;new_distribution_name&gt; &lt;install_directory&gt; &lt;tar_file_path&gt;</code></li>
<li>Replace <code>&lt;new_distribution_name&gt;</code> with the new name you want to give the distribution, <code>&lt;install_directory&gt;</code> with the directory on the external hard drive where you want to install the distribution, and <code>&lt;tar_file_path&gt;</code> with the path and filename of the tar file you copied in step 2. For example:<ul>
<li><code>wsl --import Ubuntu-external D:\vm\Ubuntu-external D:\vm\ubuntu.tar</code></li>
<li>This will create a new WSL distribution named "Ubuntu-external" in the <code>D:\vm\Ubuntu-external</code> directory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check if the distro is listed by WSL using: <code>wsl -d -v</code>. The distro name should be listed there, e.g., <code>Ubuntu-external</code>.</li>
<li>Launch it with: <code>wsl -d &lt;new_distribution_name&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Go to the root and you'll see it's somewhere else:</li>
<li><code>root@DESKTOP-3EGT6DL:~#</code></li>
</ol>
<p>This is good for the most part as you could say you are free. Before, you could not go into the root folder and were using a user. Now, you are logged in as root. To find the former root folder, go to <code>cd ../home/valiantlynx/</code> and change <code>valiantlynx</code> to your own username.</p>
